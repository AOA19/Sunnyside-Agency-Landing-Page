## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JavaScript

### What I learned

I learned how to create a mobile hamburger menu using JavaScript. I learned how important accessibility is when creating a mobile hamburger menu. I leanred how useful CSS grid is to creating various layouts for web pages like this project. There are many ways you can create a grid, but my favorite was using grid-template-areas. Using grid-template-areas made it a lot easier to visualize the actual layout you are trying to create.

### Useful resources

- [Kevin Powell's "Learn CSS Grid the easy way"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rg7Fvvl3taU) - This video from Kevin really helped me understand CSS grid a lot better. Kevin does an amazing job at explaining all the different ways to use CSS grid to create varying layouts, and he explains in a simple way that makes it easy to understand.
- [Kevin Powell's "Repsonsive navbar tutorial using HTML CSS & JS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbBMp6yUXO0&t=2327s) - This video helped me create the mobile navigation menu using JavaScript and adding accessibility.
